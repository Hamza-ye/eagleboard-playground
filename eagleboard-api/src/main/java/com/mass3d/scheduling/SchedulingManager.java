 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a job configuration {@link JobConfiguration}</li>
 * <li>This job configuration needs a job specific parameters object {@link JobParameters}, ie
 * {@link com.mass3d.scheduling.parameters.AnalyticsJobParameters}.</li>
 * <li>Call scheduleJob with the job configuration.</li>
 * <li>The schedulingManager calls the spring scheduler with a runnable object {@link
 * JobInstance}.</li>
 * <li>When the cron expression occurs the job will try to execute from the runnable object, job
 * instance.</li>
 * </ul>
